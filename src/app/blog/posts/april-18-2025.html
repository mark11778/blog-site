     ill introduce myself quickly if anyone will ever read this lol. i am mark, currently a 4th student at uw-madison. i spend a lot of my time programming and working, im sure you can figure that out from the contents of this site … well maybe not right now it is kinda empty. outside of those to things i do a lot of pretty granola activities. i love to mountain bike and rock climb.
            <br>
     but anyways i created the site to give me a place to talk and write about things that i am doing/learning with new technologies … i mean im not reinventing the wheel here just like everyone else’s personal blog. hopefully at least one other person can learn something from my mistakes, or it will just be an interesting breadcrumb trail of me breaking things that i can look back on.
